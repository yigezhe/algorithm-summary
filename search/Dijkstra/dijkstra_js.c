The above example is using a binary heap as a priority queue to ensure the running complexity:

/*
   A simple binary min-heap serving as a priority queue
   - takes an array as the input, with elements having a key property
   - elements will look like this:
        {
            key: "... key property ...", 
            value: "... element content ..."
        }
    - provides insert(), min(), extractMin() and heapify()
    - example usage (e.g. via the Firebug or Chromium console):
        int x = {foo: 20, hui: "bla"};
        int a = new BinaryMinHeap([x,{foo:3},{foo:10},{foo:20},{foo:30},{foo:6},{foo:1},{foo:3}],"foo");
        console.log(a.extractMin());
        console.log(a.extractMin());
        x.foo = 0; // update key
        a.heapify(); // call this always after having a key updated
        console.log(a.extractMin());
        console.log(a.extractMin());
    - can also be used on a simple array, like [9,7,8,5]
