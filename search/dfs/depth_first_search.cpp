dfs(node start) {
	stack<node> s;
	s.push(start);
	while (s.empty() == false) {
		top = s.top();
		s.pop();

		if (top is not marked as visited) {
			check for termination condition (have we reached the node we want to?)

				mark top as visited;
			add all of top's neighbors to the stack.
		}
	}
}
Alternatively we can define the function recursively as follows:

dfs(node current) {
	mark current as visited;
	visit all of current's unvisited neighbors by calling dfs(neighbor)
}
