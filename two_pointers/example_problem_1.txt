Given two arrays (A and B) sorted in ascending order, and an integer x. we need to find i and j, such that a[i] + b[j] is equal to X.
i and j our pointers, at first step i is points to the first element of a, and j points to the last element of b.
i = 0; j = b.size() - 1;
move first pointer one by one through the array a, and correct position of the second pointer if needed
while (i < a.size())
{
   while(a[i] + b[j] > X && j > 0) j--;
   if (a[i] + b[j] == X) writeAnswer(i, j);
   i++;
}
